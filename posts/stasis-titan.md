# Smash and Grab Stasis Titan

This Stasis Titan Build created by Duddits uses the Hoarfrost-Z exotic chest piece to use stasis shards to give us healing, over shields, a constant supply of armor charges and a constant huge damage buff from collective action perk

## WHAT YOU'LL NEED

## HOW IT WORKS

Using Hoarfrost-Z and Glaciar greandes to create a Stasis Barricade then immediately sliding through them with Cryoclasm, or shooting them with our Stasis greande launcher the New Pacific Epitaph to create Stasis Shards from Tectonic Harvest. Collecting the Stasis Shards with the Elemental Charges armour mod on will grant us Armour Charge, used with weapon surge mods and the new Collective Action weapon perk grants a stacking weapon damage buff. Ontop of that the Whisper Rime will grant you a small amount of overshield for 10 seconds from each Stasis Shard you pick-up. Using the fragment Whisper of Shards makes this very easy to chain between each other causing our grenade recharge rate to increase after destroying a Stasis Crystal.

After setting up your weapon damage buff from Collective Action and Weapon Surge mods along with your Overshield from Whisper of Rime you can start to use your Stasis Crystal offensively, either throwing your Glaciar Grenade or popping your Barricade in a group of enemies destroying the Crystals with the Whisper of Fissures fragment equipped causes the Shattering effect to deal more damage making clearing enemies out a breeze.

The last Fragment needed is Whisper of Chains, this reduces incoming damage from enemies when near a friendly Stasis Crystal. This ontop of your overshield from Whisper of Rime will make you almost un-killable as you keep stacking the overshield and damage resist onto each other as you chain through your Greande and Barricade. Adding Weapon Siphons and the Reaper mod will create Orbs of Power which can be used to start health regen with the Better Already armour mod.

## GAMEPLAY LOOP

1. Throw Glaciar Grenade and Shatter it with either your weapon or Cryoclasm slide to proc Whisper of Rime, collective action and grant yourself Armour Charge stacks.
2. Use damage buff and overshield to get close to enemies and pop your barricade and shatter it, causing Whisper of Shards to proc increasing Grenade recharge rate.
3. Deal damage to enemies with your buffed weapons and glaciar grenades creating orbs of power to start health regen all whilst reprocing your overshield.
4. Rinse and repeat.
