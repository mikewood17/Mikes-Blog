## HOW IT WORKS

This is a heavy utility build focused on keeping you alive while slowing, freezing, and shattering enemies. With its freezing capabilities, this build can handle champions without the use of anti-champion weapons.

Duskfield Grenade is the primary ability to look at. This grenade has its duration increased from 7 to 9 seconds with Whisper of Durance, will apply a 6 second freeze to enemies in its area for 1 second, and has a larger area plus a Stasis Crystal in the center with the Touch of Winter Aspect. This ability will lockdown the battlefield and be available often due to the use of Whisper of Shards which increases its regeneration rate by 500% for 6 seconds when destroying a Stasis Crystal. This effect is doubled while sprinting due to the use of FR0ST-EES. The use of FR0ST-EES will reduce the cooldowns of abilities immensely due to how often sprint is used in general play.

The build also makes use of the Whisper of Chains Fragment which will give 40% damage resistance when 10 meters or less from a Stasis Crystal. Duskfield Grenade gives this because of the Stasis Crystal it creates, which makes the grenade both offensive and defensive. This effect can also be activated through weapons with Headstone or being near any target that is frozen from abilities.

Withering Blade is another means of easily freezing targets as it applies 60 stacks of slow, and Revenant carries two charges of this ability. Both charges can be thrown to immediately freeze any target. Due to the strength of this mechanic, Gambler's Dodge is opted for to recover a charge of Withering Blade on a Dodge near an enemy. The other main means in which this cooldown is supplemented is by the use of the Grim Harvest Aspect which creates Stasis Shards when defeating Slowed or Frozen targets and gives melee energy when they are collected. These shards will also give healing and shields from the Whisper of Rime Fragment.

The mods and stats are the last bits of the build to look at. Due to the use of Whisper of Hedrons, freezing an enemy gives a 60 point increase to mobility, resilience, and recovery as well as weapon usability buffs for 11 seconds. This allows you to prioritize other stats as many opponents will be frozen when utilizing this build.

The mods of the build creates an Orb of Power for the first kill after dodging from Reaper. An orb will give energy to all three abilities, start health regeneration, and will fuel Grenade Kickstart through Armor Charges, giving grenade energy on its next use. For the other mods in use be sure to match the Siphon and Reserve mods with the weapons that are used.

## GAMEPLAY LOOP

1. Throw a Duskfield Grenade to lockdown an area with Freeze and Slow effects
2. Kill frozen enemies to create Stasis Shards from Grim Harvest and to proc shatter AoE damage to destroy the small stasis crystal to gain 500% grenade regeneration rate from Whisper of Shards
3. Sprint towards the Stasis Shards to double the effect of the 500% regeneration rate increase and gain the shield, healing, and melee energy the Stasis Shards give.
4. Use Withering Blades at an enemies to refund grenade energy from Impact Induction, and to slow them and thus produce additional Stasis Shards when killing them
5. Dodge near an enemy to fully refund one charge of Withering Blade
6. The next kill after dodge will create an Orb of Power from the Reaper mod
7. Collect the orb for health, ability regeneration, and to improve the efficacy of Grenade Kickstart
