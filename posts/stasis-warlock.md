# Osmiomancy Gloves Stasis Warlock

This Stasis Warlock Build created by Datto uses the Osmiomancy Gloves exotic to enhance coldsnap grenades. Granting you two grenade charges and amazing up-time on their regeneration allows for constant freezing from the grenade itself and passively from bleak watcher turrets.

## WHAT YOU'LL NEED

## HOW IT WORKS

Coldsnap Grenades are buffed immensely with Osmiomancy Gloves, and can be used to freeze multiple enemies on demand. For every target frozen, 25% of Coldsnap's charge will be refunded. When targets are frozen they will have Stasis Shards around them because of Glacial Harvest. Defeating frozen targets will then freeze nearby targets because of Iceflare Bolts. Only targets frozen from Coldsnap Grenades will refund grenade energy. Due to this greande recharge rate and second charge it allows for you to have a bleakwatcher turret up at all time.

Survivability of this build is from Healing Rift and leveraging Fragments. Whisper of Chains will give damage resist when near a Frozen Target or friendly stasis crystal. Whisper of Rime will give an overshield for 10 seconds when collecting Stasis Shards which are created when freezing a target or defeating a frozen target.

Weapons of the build are purely preference. If leaning heavy into freezing enemies, Using Conditional Finality, Ager's Sceptor, or Riptide with Chill Clip are all good options. Whichever weapons are chosen, be sure to match Surge and Loader mods with their element. Using Penumbral Blast will reload stowed weapons and further refunds grenade energy via Impact Induction.
