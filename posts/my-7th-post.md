# Mactics' Ashen Wake Titan Build

## HOW IT WORKS

Ashen Wake lets solar Titans throw endless Fusion Grenades by refunding grenade energy on kill. Fusion Grenades will also instantly explode on impact. Grenade energy is refunded based on the enemy type that is defeated with a grenade, from Grenade Kickstart mods, and from picking up Orbs of Power that are created from grenade via Firepower, kills after casting Barricade via Reaper, and 2 solar weapon kills via Solar Siphon. With all these avenues of grenade regeneration, you will be able to continuously throw Fusion Grenades on demand.

Grenade kills will create Orbs of Power from Firepower, create Sunspots which gives Restoration, and builds up to 3 stacks of Roaring Flames which increases ability damage. If Fusion Grenade is not available, Throwing Hammer is a great alternative to use in the meantime. It will create Sunspots, grant the Radiant buff for a 25% weapon damage boost, and maintain Roaring Flames as well. Sunspots are fantastic for healing and regenerating abilities faster.

Getting a solar weapon or ability kill will extend the timer for Restoration and Radiant with Ember of Empyrean, allowing for continuous healing and improved weapon damage. Allies will also receive the Radiant buff, which gives the extra bonus of 200% ability regeneration rate from Ember of Benevolence. Ability regeneration is further supplemented by Ember of Searing creating Firesprites when defeating Scorched enemies, which when picked up reduce cooldowns.

The weapon of the build are best with the Incandescent perk. This will ensure the weapon is solar so it activates Ember of Empyrean, and it will scorch targets to activate Ember of Searing to create Firesprites.
