# Assassins Arc Hunter

## HOW IT WORKS

There are a lot of moving pieces to this build, but what it ultimately comes down to is landing high damage melees which give a plethora of effects on a kill, making this up close and personal melee build very survivable. The interaction between **Gambler's Dodge** and **Combination Blow** is most important to learn. **Gambler's Dodge will refill Combination Blow** when near an enemy, and defeating a target with **Combination Blow will completely refill Gambler's Dodge** energy.

The benefits of using a melee on an enemy are plenty. The first is tied in an Aspect, **Lethal Current**, which is activated after dodging and increases **melee lunge distance**, **Jolts**, and creates an **aftershock** that damages nearby enemies. The exotic **Assassin's Cowl** makes melee kills and finishers restore some **health** and grants **invisibility**. Mods will make melee kills create **Orbs of Power** as well as **replenish super and grenade energy**.

The other two abilities in the build, **Gathering Storm** and **Pulse Grenade**, are nothing to scoff at. **Gathering Storm** is a very strong single target damage super, and **Pulse Grenade** is strong in its own right, but is extended with **Spark of Magnitude** and **Jolts** targets with **Spark of Shock**. Be sure to utilize these abilities when possible.The last bit of the build is in weapons.

Using a shotgun with **One-Two Punch** will increase melee damage even further, and is strongly recommended in this build. The other two options are quite flexible. With **Combination Blow** being the primary means in which enemies are damaged, using two special weapons is best, and the other slot can be occupied by **Witherhoard**, **Arbalest**, a **Trace Rifle**, or a **grenade launcher**. Using two special weapons will also create more **heavy bricks** for the heavy weapon of your choice.

## GAMEPLAY LOOP

1. Dodge to activate Lethal Current and refill melee energy if needed
2. Melee an enemy to build a stack of Combination Blow, Jolt the target, create a damaging aftershock, heal, refill Dodge energy, spawn an Orb of Power, and go invisible
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until Combination Blow is at maximum stacks (up to 3 stacks)
4. Continue chaining dodges, melees, and finishers to keep Combination Blow stacks up and receive all of the benefits from melee kills and Assassin's Cowl
5. Damage down and Jolt higher health targets with Pulse Grenade and Gathering Storm when they are available as well as utilize a One-Two Punch shotgun to increase melee damage
