# Aztecross' Solar Hunter Build

This Solar Hunter Build created by Aztecross utilises oathkeepers in tandem with wishender for extended damage, healing and ability up-time.

## WHAT YOU'LL NEED

## HOW IT WORKS

General ad clear is carried by Wish-Ender in tandem with Oathkeeper. This bow is a top exotic in the game due to its over-penetration damage, and Oathkeeper adds roughly a 150% damage buff when holding the bow for a few extra seconds.

The subclass has a general gameplay loop of getting Restoration from Healing Grenade and Radiant from Acrobat's Dodge. Acrobat's Dodge and the Radiant timer will get refunded from a precision kill with Weighted Throwing Knife, and the timers for Radiant and Restoration are reset by solar weapon kills with Ember of Empyrean.

Use as many Kinetic Weapon Surge mods as possible to maximize Wish-Ender's damage. To make Orbs of Power for armor charge stacks, land Wish-Ender kills with Kinetic Siphon or get a kill after Acrobat's Ddoge with Reaper. With Orbs on the ground, Acrobat's Dodge will pick them up with use of Powerful Attraction. This will keep up Wish-Ender's increased damage and even increase Golden Gun's damage as it is increased by Kinetic Surge mods.

## GAMEPLAY LOOP

1. Grant Radiant to yourself and allies with Acrobat's Dodge
2. Get Cure and Restoration with Healing Grenade
3. Get a precision kill with Weighted Throwing Knife to refund Acrobat's Dodge and melee
4. Use Wish-Ender for general ad clear and Explosive Personality to reset Radiant and Restoration's timers
5. Use Acrobat's Dodge to become Radiant once again and collect nearby Orbs of Power for Surge mods
6. Use Golden Gun which is buffed by Surge mods
