# Mactics Void Contraverse Hold Warlock Build

## HOW IT WORKS

Chaos Accelerant and Contraverse Hold work wonders together, and allow an overcharged Vortex Grenade to have a miniscule cooldown. A standard Vortex Grenade lasts 3.2 seconds, and when overcharged will last 4.2 seconds. This time bump works perfectly with Contraverse Hold because the 2000% grenade regeneration rate increase has an internal cooldown of 1.75 seconds. This duration increase will allow Contraverse Hold's effect to activate twice in one grenade.

Grenade kills will create Orbs of Power which will come in droves. Picking up these orbs will reduce grenade's cooldown even further, activate surge mods for increased weapon damage, and best of all activate Devour via Echo of Starvation. Because orbs are so abundant, there is no need to run Feed the Void, and Child of the Old Gods is opted for instead. Child of the Old Gods will refund grenade energy when damaging enemies, and Devour will not only heal on a kill, but will reduce grenade cooldown as well.

## GAMEPLAY LOOP

1. Cast Rift to make Child of the Old Gods available
2. Overcharge and throw Vortex Grenade by holding down the grenade button
3. Pick up the Orbs of Power that are created from grenade kills
4. Utilize Void weapons buffed by Surge mods
5. Throw overcharged grenades on cooldown
