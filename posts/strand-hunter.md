# Lucky Pants and Malfeasance Hunter

This Strand Hunter Build created by Plunder uses the combination of the Malfeasance and Lucky pants exotics to trap enemies with suspend then draw your hand cannon to destroy any champions with Lucky Pants' escalting damage bonus. This Build was already incredible last season (21) but with the addition of Malfeasances catalyst in season of the deep giving this already incredible gun vorpal weapon turns this build into a monster.

## WHAT YOU'LL NEED

## HOW IT WORKS

This build combines two Exotics that turn it into a Champion Eater! With Strand being so strong on the Hunter, what better way to take advantage of that infinite suspension than with Lucky Pants!

Suspended targets are easy to hit now, and you donâ€™t have to worry about being shot at while unloading a 20 Round Malfeasance. This makes for the perfect pairing with Lucky Pants' 600% damage increase to Malfeasance that already hits like a truck!

All that is needed is to Suspend a Champion with Shackle Grenade, then whip out Malfeasance and this will proc Lucky Pants and allow you to kill any champion in one clip. With the recent 20% Hand cannon buff to Malfeasance as well and the Kinetic Surge mods and its new addition of vorpal weapon from it's catalyst, you can stack great damage while being on an amazing crowd control subclass with Strand.

## GAMEPLAY LOOP

1. Use Shackle Grenade to Suspend
2. Activate Lucky Pants by pulling out Malfeasance
3. This will proc Lucky Pants Combined with Malfeasance to eat Champions
4. Throw grenade as soon as you need to and just go to town with Malfeasance
5. Grab Orbs of Power which will heal you and provide a Damage Boost
6. Continue this loop for infinite High damage Malfeasance rounds
